I couldn`t ignore ignored first step in any path of programmer - "Hello world!"

First when I learnt Java this example used with different strings like "Kiss my shiny metal ass". Eah, quote Bender is fun.

 It is my first program, maybe it is first program for all programmers. It is begin. The running program just print string in terminal.
 
{% highlight java linenos%}
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello World!");
        }
    }

{% endhighlight %}
