I created this blog because I want use and train my knowledge.
More will be about Java programming language, but I not leave you without motivation posts and jokes.
Here I will write my path, my experience in Java learning. If I use examples from books or in other places then I try explain more then the author of book, have other look or experience.
I hope this blog will be useful for you.

P.S. Sorry for my grammar error. If it is not difficult for you, please, tell me more about my mistakes in discussion.
